  "readme": "# Bootswatch\n\n[![Bootswatch Logo](https://bootswatch.com/_assets/img/logo-dark.png)](https://bootswatch.com)\n\nBootswatch is a collection of open source themes for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are a few different ways you can integrate Bootswatch into your project.\n\n### Via Pre-compiled Asset\n\nDownload the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace\nBootstrap's default stylesheet.  You must still include Bootstrap's JavaScript\nfile to have functional dropdowns, modals, etc.\n\n### Via CDN\n\nSimilar to above, but you can hotlink to the appropriate `bootstrap.min.css`\nhosted on [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/).\n\n### Via Sass Imports\n\nIf you're using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) in your project, you can\nimport the `_variables.scss` and `_bootswatch.scss` files for a given theme.\nThis method allows you to override theme variables.\n\n```scss\n// Your variable overrides go here, e.g.:\n// $h1-font-size: 3rem;\n\n@import \"~bootswatch/dist/[theme]/variables\";\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n@import \"~bootswatch/dist/[theme]/bootswatch\";\n```\n\nMake sure to import Bootstrap's `bootstrap.scss` in between `_variables.scss`\nand `_bootswatch.scss`!\n\n### Via NPM\n\nYou can install as a package with the command `npm install bootswatch`.\n\n#### React Users (`create-react-app`, or similar bundler)\n\nModern JavaScript bundlers (webpack, parcel, rollup) support `import`ing CSS from JS files. This can make it easier to deploy various 1st and 3rd party assets predictably. Note: _There are tradeoffs to the following method, research your tooling before deploying to production._\n\nBefore continuing, ensure you've run `npm install bootswatch` in your local project folder. (Use either `npm` or `yarn`.)\n\nAdd the following `import` to your top-level `index.js` (or `App.js`) file. Add it **before** any other `.css` imports.\n\n```js\nimport \"bootswatch/dist/[theme]/bootstrap.min.css\"; \n// TODO: Note: Replace ^[theme]^ (examples: darkly, slate, cosmo, spacelab, and superhero. See https://bootswatch.com for current theme names.)\n```\n\n\nHere's an example of updated `imports` in `App.js` to use \"slate\" theme (using a `create-react-app` fresh project.)\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport 'bootswatch/dist/slate/bootstrap.min.css'; // Added this :boom:\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n...\n```\n\n\n### Via Ruby Gem\n\nIn your Ruby project, you can access the latest version of each theme by adding\nthe following to your Gemfile and running `bundle install`:\n\n```ruby\ngem \"bootswatch\", github: \"thomaspark/bootswatch\"\n```\n\nEach theme directory is then accessible via the path\n`\"#{Gem.loaded_specs[\"bootswatch\"].load_paths.first}/[theme]\"`.\n\nRuby on Rails users can add the following to an initializer (e.g.\n`config/initializers/bootswatch.rb`):\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.assets.paths += Gem.loaded_specs[\"bootswatch\"].load_paths\n```\n\nAnd thus be able to import themes via Sass like so:\n\n```scss\n@import \"[theme]/variables\";\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n@import \"[theme]/bootswatch\";\n```\n\n### Via API\n\nA simple JSON API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch.\nMore info can be found on the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#api).\n\n\n## Customization\n\nBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.\n\nEach theme consists of two SASS files. `_variables.scss`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize the settings. `_bootswatch.scss` introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nCheck out the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#customization) for more details on building your own theme.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIt's through your contributions that Bootswatch will continue to improve. You can contribute in several ways.\n\n**Issues:** Provide a detailed report of any bugs you encounter and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/issues).\n\n**Documentation:** If you'd like to fix a typo or beef up the docs, you can fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.\n\n**Code:** Make a fix and submit it as a pull request. When making changes, it's important to keep the CSS and SASS versions in sync. To do this, be sure to edit the SASS source files for the particular theme first, then run the  tasks `grunt swatch` to build the CSS.\n\n**Donation:** Donations are gratefully accepted via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/thomaspark/) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PU2DH4BMF9MWS&source=url).\n\n\n## Author\n\nThomas Park\n\n+ https://github.com/thomaspark\n+ https://thomaspark.co\n\n\n## Thanks\n\n[Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).\n\n[Jenil Gogari](http://www.jgog.in/) for his contributions to the Flatly theme.\n\n[James Taylor](https://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\n\n[Corey Sewell](https://github.com/cjsewell) for SASS conversion.\n\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nCopyright 2014-2019 Thomas Park\n\nCode released under the MIT License.\n",
